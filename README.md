# Until It's Not Fun: A Newsletter
This is an open source website for our newsletter [Until It's Not Fun](https://untilitsnotfun.com), written by Jacob McLane and [Westley Winks](https://westleywinks.com). We are just a couple of friends that wanted to build a newsletter for ourselves, with no expectations other than having fun. [Subscribe here](https://buttondown.email/untilitsnotfun) to get our emails or [click here](https://untilitsnotfun.com) to see our past posts.
