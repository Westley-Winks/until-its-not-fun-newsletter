<p>I can‚Äôt tell if this movie is a horror, suspenseful, maybe a romance? But it‚Äôs nothing like I‚Äôve seen before!
I started watching this with very little insight on the story, so I was on the ride through the whole thing. To me personally, it‚Äôs not a movie I‚Äôm going to re-watched 5 times like others, but I did enjoy it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not going to spoil the twists, so here is a brief over view of the story.</p>
<p>We follow a young woman, in the dating scene. She is on the verge of giving up on the whole idea when she meets a guy that sparks hope in this desert of ‚Äúgood guys.‚Äù We follow her on the beginnings of what seems to be a very promising relationship. But that takes a turn.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for a good movie to watch with a friend that will definitely make your skin crawl (if it doesn‚Äôt, we need to talk), then this is a good pick!</p>

<h5 id="where-westley-talks-about-discord-bots"><em>Where Westley talks about Discord Bots</em></h5>
<p>In January 2022, I built my first Discord bot. It was very crudely put together and completely unreliable. Jacob wanted a bot in the server that would randomly insult our friends during the day. Put simply, he wanted a bot that was mildly an asshole. On that weekday in Powell Butte, Complibot was born.</p>
<p>I threw together Complibot v0 in a few hours using Python and a couple tutorials. Simplicity and fun was the goal at that point. Since I am very comfortable with Python, I opted to use a third party package,  

<a  href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">discord.py,</a>

 that wraps Discord&rsquo;s API&rsquo;s which are normally used with Javascript. The goal was to have Complibot send a random insult or compliment (I didn&rsquo;t want her to be too mean) to someone twice a day, at random times.</p>
<p>She was completely unpredictable. I couldn&rsquo;t get the randomness and time (we didn&rsquo;t want her pinging us in the middle of the night) to work with the asynchronous nature of the Python functions. I converted it to use commands like <code>/insult</code> and <code>/compliment</code> to trigger it or whenever she was mentioned. This worked fine except for the weighting between her picking an insult or a compliment. On average, she should have sent one compliment for every insult; all of her responses were insults. To this day, I have no idea why the weighting wasn&rsquo;t 50/50.</p>
<p>Not only that, the channel members were static; I handwrote everyone&rsquo;s member ID into a <code>.txt</code> file and she picked from that randomly. Every time someone joined the server, I would have to edit that <code>.txt</code> file to put the new member in the pool to be selected. The code was embarrassingly bad but, hey, it worked and made my friends laugh.</p>
<p>The deployment was even worse. I deployed Complibot on Heroku where she listened and was running 24/7. Because I was too cheap to get out of Heroku&rsquo;s free tier, Heroku limited the time to about three weeks per month. Complibot didn&rsquo;t even work for the last week of the month.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about a failed bot I built months ago? Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I released a newly developed and much, <em>much</em> better version, Complibot v1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I recently applied for a job at Discord so I have been thinking about bots lately</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For Complibot v1, I completely rebuilt it from the ground up. In most of Discord&rsquo;s guides and resources, they use Javascript. Any time is a good time to learn a new programming language! In one weekend, I had a bot that works every time, is deployed much more reliably, and  

<a  href="https://github.com/Westley-Winks/complibot"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">is open source</a>

. I came out with Javascript knowledge and continuous deployment knowledge.</p>
<p>Discord&rsquo;s  

<a  href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting started guide</a>

 helped immensely. I took most of Complibot&rsquo;s parts and pieces from their demo project. Complibot now has full support for slash commands. When you start typing a Complibot command, Discord shows the description of what the command does and also prompts the user what to put in after the command.</p>
<p>I am most excited about the deployment. Complibot now lives on Google Cloud Platform&rsquo;s Cloud Run. Cloud Run is a serverless platform that runs apps. Because it is serverless, Complibot isn&rsquo;t constantly running and increasing my bill. It goes to sleep after 300 seconds of inactivity and wakes back up whenever someone sends her a command. She only takes about three seconds to wake up and send a response. Cloud Run also connects nicely with Cloud Build. Cloud Build is configured to trigger a build whenever there is a push to the main codebase on Complibot&rsquo;s GitHub repo. This makes my life so much easier and I am able to make changes on the fly. When I push changes to share my code on GitHub, those changes are automatically reflected in the Discord channel within minutes thanks to GCP.</p>
<p>Using this same process, I <del>am working on</del> built a bot that sends a message to Discord whenever this newsletter gets sent out each week. You might be thinking, &ldquo;Why? Isn&rsquo;t that exactly what an email does? Subscribers will get a message in their emails whenever this newsletter gets sent out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is exactly right. But learning is fun, so why <em>not</em>?</p>
<p>Keep learning.</p>
<p>I leave you with some Complibot samples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-md" data-lang="md"><span style="display:flex;"><span>/compliment: You‚Äôre great at figuring stuff out.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>/insult: If I typed ‚Äòstupid‚Äô in google, your name would pop up.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ouch.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant,</p>
<p>Westley</p>
